シンプル (shinpuru), a simple *(as the name says)* yet future rich multi purpose Discord Bot written in Go using bwmarrin's package [discord.go](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) as Discord API and gateway wrapper and [shireikan](https://github.com/zekroTJA/shireikan) as command handler. shinpuru features general moderation features like member reporting, kicking, banning, and chat muting; guild security features like guild backups, invite link protection and raid detection; and fun features like a starboard, guild karma, votes, cloud code execution and much more! All of that available via commands or via the web interface.
