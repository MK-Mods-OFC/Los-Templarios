# `.vscode`

This is an automatically generated direcotry used by Visual Studio Code to store settings like [debug profiles](launch.json) or [workspace preferences](settings.json).

Actually, this directory should be ignored by SCM, but I wanted to provide the [debug profile](launch.json) I am using for shinpuru so that you can easily use it as well.
